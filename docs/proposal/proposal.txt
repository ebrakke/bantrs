Proposal #1: A community based website that allows a user to see content being posted within a specified radius.  Users of this website will be posting things like news articles, community posts, and current songs they are listening to.  They can then see what people around them are posting by searching within a certain distance.  When viewing content, users have a chance to join in a discussion about whatever they are viewing, but the size of the discussion is limited to those within the area.  Users also have the option of joining in private conversation with their friends to post and discuss any content they wish.  A database will be used to store user profiles, content generated on the website, and the location data of the users.  APIs utilized will be popular music APIs (Spotify and Soundcloud) and possibly a maps API as well.  

Proposal #2: An app that allows you to go into a restaurant, order food from your phone, and have the payment get sent right to the restaurant after you order.  This is allow for users to order food at their convenience at the table without having to deal with a waiter or waitress to take their orders.  The user is then free to leave at their leisure without having to wait for the check because the app handles all of the payments.  A database would be used to store user accounts and restaurant information.  One API that would be used would be to pull restaurant information (location, menu items, etc.).  Another API we would use would be a payment app API (LevelUp, Square).  The idea is that if the restaurant is already using one of these mobile payment apps, then our app will not have to handle any of the payments.  It will just be able to initiate the transaction.
